# BudgIt App

This project was created as a part of University of Helsinki Full-stack WebDev course. The work was going smoothly up until September 2021 and then has abrubtly ended.

Now, over a year has passed an it is time to get back to it.

## Quick remarks after the submission for 7 credits.

After submission there will still be work on the project as I would like to continue developing it for personal use. So please for grading refer to main branch. There are still 2 key issues in my opinion that are present in this project:

    a. Minor security vulnerabilities. While main points are resolved from what I have gathered, there is still a lot of
    'openly' accessible endpoints, which should not happen and auth related issues.
    b. Low test coverage on the backend and non-existed testing on the frontend.

Once those issues are resolved, new features for the app will be developed.

That is all,
Thank you in advance for reviewing my project.
Will be happy to get a feedback.

## App description and where it could be found

The application is a budget tracker made both for the individuals and/ or the families (or friends). User has the possibility to have personal plan to strictly track own money spendings as well as making a common plan with other users via creation of a "Family plan".

The expenses are added manually via "Spending form", where user has to provide a specific name of the spending, create or select existing category of the expense, enter the amount of money spent and lastly select a date, which is defaulted to the current day.

In addition to that, it is possible to have a graphical representation of the spendings filtered by the month or the year, where it is also possible to see, how spendings are distributed by categories.

In the future, the app aims to add the functionality own keeping track of earning, so that the user would have the most accurate representation of own financial situation.

The app can be accessed at http://budg-it.com/

Some intial entries were not too specific, as unfortunately during my first year of studies I was even worse at reading the instructions than now. Hopefully given report will be enough.
