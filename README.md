# BudgIt App

This project was created as a part of University of Helsinki Full-stakc WebDev course. The work was going smoothly up until September 2021.

Now, over a year has passed an it is time to get back to it.

Time spent bullets. Well, I was at times not to specific with the categories, so let me write down everything that was done before sep/ 2021

1. Initializing backend - 0.5h
2. Login/ Signup backend - 1h
3. Google auth - 4h
4. Frontend login - 1.2h
5. Logout + signup - 2.5h
6. Email confirmation - 2.25h
7. Backend personal plan - 2h
8. Fixing nodemon - 1h
9. _Most vague category - includes practically all frontend work_ Frontend personal plan - 27.5h
10. Change password UI + Backend - 1h
11. Code refactoring and bug fixing - 10h
12. Deckerizing app - 6h (yes, at the time it was hard)
13. Redis - 2h
14. Merge of 2 user models into a single one - 1h
15. Dockerizing and configuring ES. Elasticsearch query to find users by username - 2.5h
16. Setting up test env - 1h
17. Family plan reducer and creation - 1.5h (starting from this point I apparently saw the document on how logging of hours should be done)
18. FamilyPlanHome Frontend - 3.5h
19. FrontEnd Invitation mechanism + some styling - 2.5h
20. Frontend accept invitations mechanism + styling - 5.5h

Now starts the part of 2022 development:

21. Basic unit tests for reducers - 0.5h
22. Fixing login/ sign up styling + setting up proper nodemailer environment - 0.75h
23. Add expenses to family plan - 0.5h

Intially, whilst being a lazy programmer - I was all for the JS. After working for some time in the industry and taking a deep dive into the TS, I have realised how important typing is. After not touching the project for over a year it is also a challenge to revive and maintain it. Thus, the decision was made that maybe it is for the best to migrate slowly everything to typescript:

24. TS migration - 0.5h

CURRENT: 80.75h
GOAL: 122.5h
